I was one of those “never let them see you sweat” types. I felt like I was handling all of life stresses really well. I had survived some big losses, “managed” my grief, and was managing a life-threatening illness for over 11 years. I never realized I had life-long anxiety until I was in my 40s. I appeared easy-breezy on the outside, and found I was physically clenching my feet and hands from unconscious stress. I realized I was dissociating from my body/feelings by being overly positive when hard things happened to me. I always held my entire body tightly, like I was bracing for what was next. I didn’t know how to allow my body to relax. Connecting into my body didn’t feel safe, accessible, or even realistic.

Tapping (EFT) shifted all of this for me. I started to feel my feet and hands relax when I would tune into them. I started to take full breaths without thinking about it. I started to acknowledge the feelings I had been hiding, the hurt and the traumas. It was such a gentle process honoring where I was at at every moment, and so peaceful. I let my "messy feelings" out and, to my surprise, I didn’t feel ashamed. I felt immense compassion for the younger versions of me. I came to understand why the old feelings were there and why they didn’t feel safe to be expressed. I discovered when I listened to the emotions I was holding back, it didn’t make them stronger, like I was fearing it would. It just allowed them to be heard.

The more I did this, the more my body physically and noticeably relaxed, the more my mind became peaceful and the more my spirit felt free! Even more, I started relating to people differently. I felt challenging relationships start to soften and become safe, loving and supportive. I listened to myself and said what was important to me without attachment to how it would be received. I began listening deeper. My whole life changed before me in the most beautiful way, and my body began to heal because I was able to not only ask for the help I needed, but to 'accept' others help too.
 
Holding emotions in and not speaking our truth does not keep us or others happy. In fact it does the opposite, and keeps us stuck! It forms an invisible barrier between you and the people you care about, preventing either side from really feeling the other. Funny how our protective shields protect us, and yet at the same time, can so easily cage us in.

I invite you to peek out from behind the shield. Love yourself so much that you are willing to embrace ALL parts of you. To step into a more peaceful, powerful and whole being that you are. The world is anxiously awaiting to meet the true and strongest version of you! If you wish, it’s a path that can be supportive, accepting, loving and empowering, I would love the opportunity to walk with you on your journey
