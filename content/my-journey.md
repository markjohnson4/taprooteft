I am a Certified Clinical Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) Practitioner and Empath Empowerment Guide. I have a deep understanding of what it's like to feel others' energy intensely, as I've experienced it firsthand throughout my life. For the longest time, I viewed my empathic nature as a weakness. It often felt overwhelming and took a toll on my health. I have worked through major losses, childhood trauma, stage 4 cancer and night terrors, which further deepened my understanding of the complexities of trauma and its effects on our well-being.
 
In my quest for healing and self-realization, I discovered the transformative power of EFT. Through this modality, I gained the tools to shed the layers of emotional pain associated with loss and trauma. EFT became a catalyst for my personal growth and allowed me to reclaim my power, transforming my empathic abilities from a burden into a source of strength. I was able to embrace being an empath as my superpower.
 
Now, my mission is to guide fellow empaths towards self-empowerment and help them unlock their full potential. I believe that empaths have a unique gift to offer the world, but it's essential to do so without compromising their own well-being. I provide a safe and nurturing space for empaths to explore their sensitivity and establish healthy boundaries.
 
With my expertise in Clinical EFT and my personal journey of healing, I offer a holistic approach to empower empaths to serve others while maintaining their own emotional and energetic balance. Together, we'll navigate the complexities of energy sensitivity, uncover your innate strengths for you to make a profound difference in the lives of others.
 
I'm truly passionate about helping you embrace your sensitivity as a source of strength, recognizing it as a superpower and using it to create positive change in the world. If you're ready to embark on a transformative journey towards self-empowerment and impactful service, I'm here to support you every step of the way.
