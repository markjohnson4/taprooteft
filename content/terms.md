Through the Site, certain products, programs, e-courses, and consulting services may be offered for purchase, all of which are referred to as the “Products and/or Services”. The fees for such Products and/or Services are as listed on the Site. All fees are due at the time of booking the Products and/or Services unless otherwise indicated on the Site, and Taproot EFT will have no obligation to provide Products and/or Services until such fees are paid. All Products and/or Services are subject to these Terms of Use.

### Products and/or Services Descriptions
We try to make the Site thorough, accurate, and helpful to our customers. Nonetheless, there may be times when certain information contained on the Site may be incorrect, incomplete, inaccurate, or appear inaccurate because of the browser, hardware, or other technology that you use. We apologize in advance for any such errors that may result in an incorrect price, inaccurate description, item unavailability or otherwise affect your order. We reserve the right to correct errors (whether by changing information on the Site or by informing you of the error and giving you an opportunity to cancel your order) or to update Product information at any time without notice.

### Availability and Pricing

We may occasionally make errors in the stated prices on this Site. If a Service’s correct price is higher than the listed price, we will, in our discretion, either confirm the correct price with you or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation.

### Purchasing Products and Services

The display of Products and/or Services on the Site invites you to make an offer to purchase the Products and/or Services. Your order is an offer to buy the Products and/or Services, which we accept only by providing the Products and/or Services or confirming your request for Products and/or Services. Any confirmation that you receive after placing an order does not constitute an acceptance of your offer and is subject to correction for any reason.

Completion of a payment transaction is contingent upon: (a) you providing complete personal, account, transaction and any other information needed, (b) authorization of the payment by your credit or debit card company, and (c) acceptance of your payment. You may cancel your payment prior to your final submission of it to us.

## Disputes

Subject to applicable law, you and Taproot EFT agree that any dispute that has arisen or may arise between us relating in any way to your use of or access to the Services or Site, any breach, enforcement, or termination of these Terms, or otherwise relating to Taproot EFT in any way will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Section.

### Informal Resolution

If you have any dispute with us, you agree that before taking any formal action, you will contact us at TaprootEFT@gmail.com, provide a brief, written description of the dispute and your contact information (including your username, if your dispute relates to an account) and allow sixty (60) days to pass, during which we will attempt to reach an amicable resolution of any issue.

### Arbitration

These Terms and each of its parts evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce, and the Federal Arbitration Act applies in all cases and governs the interpretation and enforcement of the arbitration rules and arbitration proceedings. Any Covered Matters must be asserted individually in binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Terms and the AAA Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (including, without limitation, utilizing desk, phone or video conference proceedings where appropriate and permitted to mitigate costs of travel). The arbitrator shall not conduct any form of class or collective arbitration nor join or consolidate claims by or for individuals. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable or a particular claim is subject to arbitration. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

### Award

For matters where the relief sought is over $5,000, the arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Taproot EFT user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER USERS.

### Exceptions

There are only two exceptions to this arbitration agreement:

First, if a party reasonably believes that the other party has in any manner infringed or threatened to infringe the intellectual property rights of the other party, the party who owns the intellectual property rights may seek injunctive or other appropriate interim relief in any court of competent jurisdiction.

Second, any claim of $500 or less may, at the option of the claiming party, be resolved in small claims court within the United States, if the claim and the parties are within the jurisdiction of the small claims court and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.

### Costs of Arbitration

Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules, unless otherwise stated in this agreement to arbitrate. If the value of the relief sought is $5,000 or less, at your request, Taproot EFT will reimburse you for all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration following the earlier of the arbitrator’s decision or settlement. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, Taproot EFT is relieved of its obligation to reimburse you for any fees associated with the arbitration.

### Future Amendments to the Agreement to Arbitrate

Notwithstanding any provision in the Terms to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any amendment to this agreement to arbitrate in the future, that amendment shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against Taproot EFT prior to the effective date of the amendment. The amendment shall apply to all other disputes or claims governed by the agreement to arbitrate that have arisen or may arise between you and Taproot EFT. If you do not agree to these amended terms, you may close your account within thirty (30) days of the posting or notification and you will not be bound by the amended terms.

### Judicial Forum for Legal Disputes

Unless you and we agree otherwise, in the event that the agreement to arbitrate above is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or dispute, either as a result of your decision to opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order or because you have chosen to file an eligible lawsuit in small claims court, you agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and Taproot EFT must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in Maricopa County, Arizona. You and Taproot EFT agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Maricopa County, Arizona for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.

### Opt-Out

IF YOU ARE A NEW Taproot EFT USER, YOU CAN CHOOSE TO REJECT THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE PROVISION ("OPT-OUT") BY EMAILING US AN OPT-OUT NOTICE TO TaprootEFT@gmail.com ("OPT-OUT NOTICE"): Taproot EFT. THE OPT-OUT NOTICE MUST BE RECEIVED NO LATER THAN THIRTY (30) DAYS AFTER THE DATE YOU ACCEPT THE TERMS OF SERVICE FOR THE FIRST TIME. IF YOU ARE NOT A NEW Taproot EFT USER, YOU HAVE UNTIL THIRTY (30) DAYS AFTER THE POSTING OF THE NEW TERMS OF SERVICE TO SUBMIT AN ARBITRATION OPTOUT NOTICE.

Procedure. In order to opt-out, you must email your name, address (including street address, city, state, and zip code), and email address(es) associated with your Account(s) to which the opt-out applies and an unaltered digital image of a valid driver’s license which matches the name on your account to: TaprootEFT@gmail.com. This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the agreement to arbitrate. If you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, all other parts of the agreement and its Disputes Section will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this agreement to arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us.

### Waiver

BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO A COURT TRIAL (OTHER THAN SMALL CLAIMS COURT AS PROVIDED BELOW) OR TO SERVE AS A REPRESENTATIVE, AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR IN ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS, IN ANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING FILED AGAINST US AND/OR RELATED THIRD PARTIES.

## Indemnification

You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold Taproot EFT and all of our officers, directors, mangers, members, employees, agents, information providers, affiliates, partners, and licensors (“Taproot EFT Party,” or collectively, the “Taproot EFT Parties”) harmless from and against any and all liability, claims, damages, losses, costs, and expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred by any Taproot EFT Party arising from, related to, or in connection with (a) a violation of any provision of these Terms by you; or (b) arising from, related to, or connected with your violation of the rights of Taproot EFT or any other person or entity. We may, in our sole and absolute discretion, control the disposition of any such claim at your sole cost and expense. You may not settle any such claim without our express written consent. This defense and indemnification obligation is intended to extend to the fullest extent permitted by law and will survive these Terms and your use of the Site.

## Warranties & Disclaimers

### Service Outages and Force Majeure
