due at the time of booking the Products and/or Services unless otherwise indicated on the Site,
and Taproot EFT will have no obligation to provide Products and/or Services until such fees are
paid. All Products and/or Services are subject to these Terms of Use.
Products and/or Services Descriptions. We try to make the Site thorough, accurate, and helpful
to our customers. Nonetheless, there may be times when certain information contained on the
Site may be incorrect, incomplete, inaccurate, or appear inaccurate because of the browser,
hardware, or other technology that you use. We apologize in advance for any such errors that
may result in an incorrect price, inaccurate description, item unavailability or otherwise affect
your order. We reserve the right to correct errors (whether by changing information on the Site
or by informing you of the error and giving you an opportunity to cancel your order) or to update
Product information at any time without notice.
Availability and Pricing. Taproot EFT reserves the right to change the prices and available
Products and/or Services at any time. Quantities of some Products and/or Services may be
limited and availability cannot always be guaranteed. Products and/or Services offered for sale
on this Site are for sale only in the United States and all prices are quoted in U.S. dollars. We
may occasionally make errors in the stated prices on this Site. If a Service’s correct price is
higher than the listed price, we will, in our discretion, either confirm the correct price with you or
cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation.
Purchasing Products and Services. The display of Products and/or Services on the Site invites
you to make an offer to purchase the Products and/or Services. Your order is an offer to buy the
Products and/or Services, which we accept only by providing the Products and/or Services or
confirming your request for Products and/or Services. Any confirmation that you receive after
placing an order does not constitute an acceptance of your offer and is subject to correction for
any reason.
Orders. We have the right to refuse or limit any orders and limit quantities. We will not be liable
if a Service is unavailable or if the date of Services need to be rescheduled. All orders are noncancelable; we may grant or deny cancellation requests in our sole and absolute discretion. We
reserve the right to provide substantially similar Products or Services to fulfill your order.
Rescheduling. Should you need to reschedule a one-on-one Services session, you may do so by
providing 24-hour notice in advance of your session by emailing Taproot EFT at
<a href=mailto:TaprootEFT@gmail.com>TaprootEFT@gmail.com</a>. Sessions not cancelled 24 hours in advance will be charged full price.
Group Services sessions are not subject to rescheduling, and no refunds are granted if you are
unavailable to attend.
Returns. We do not allow returns or substitutions of Products and/or Services. All sales are
final.
Payment. You authorize us (and any payment processor) to charge your payment card for all
purchases you make. We accept the forms of payment stated on the Site and, for credit card
payments, charge your credit card when your order is processed. The bank issuing your credit
card may control when to release funds in the case of an order cancellation or refund. We reserve
the right to use the payment information you provide us in connection with this payment to
provide better service to you should you wish to use our service again in the future and to protect
us from fraud and other losses. Completion of a payment transaction is contingent upon: (a) you
providing complete personal, account, transaction and any other information needed, (b)
authorization of the payment by your credit or debit card company, and (c) acceptance of your
payment. You may cancel your payment prior to your final submission of it to us. We may, in
our sole discretion, cancel your payment at any time by providing notice to you through your
contact information or by a notice when you attempt to make a payment. We may cancel a
payment or prevent you from initiating future payments for any reason, including, without
limitation, the following: (i) if you attempt to use the Products and/or Services in breach of any
applicable law or regulation, including the card network rules or regulations; (ii) if you use the
Products and/or Services in breach of these Terms; (iii) if we suspect fraudulent, unlawful or
improper activity regarding a payment; (iv) if we detect, in our sole discretion, that your
payments have excessive disputes, high reversal rates or present a relatively high risk of losses;
or (v) failure to cooperate in an investigation or provide additional information when requested.
Taxes. Stated prices do not include any customs duties, sales, use, value-added, excise, federal,
state, local or other taxes. You are solely responsible for the payment of such taxes related to
your purchase. We have the right to charge you for any taxes that we believe we are required to
pay or collect related to your purchase.
Personal Use Only. Products and/or Services are for your personal use only. You agree not sell
or resell any Products and/or Services you purchase.
No Harassment. You agree to treat Taproot EFT and its principals, employees, and contractors
in a professional capacity at all times, and Taproot EFT reserves the right to suspend and
terminate Services to you at any time without refund in the event Taproot EFT feels unsafe or
uncomfortable in any way.
Group Sessions. If the Services include any group sessions with third-party participants, you
agree to not disclose, authorize disclosure, publish, post, circulate or otherwise disseminate any
information learned, disclosed or obtained of any kind, relating directly or indirectly to any thirdparty participants present at the Services (“Confidential Information”). You further acknowledge
and agree that although confidentiality is generally required of all group session participants,
Taproot EFT cannot guarantee that third-party participants present at the Services will maintain
confidentiality of any information you share, and you hereby release Taproot EFT from any and
all claims associated with the disclosure of information you share at group sessions by a thirdparty participant.

DISPUTES
Subject to applicable law, you and Taproot EFT agree that any dispute that has arisen or may
arise between us relating in any way to your use of or access to the Services or Site, any breach,
enforcement, or termination of these Terms, or otherwise relating to Taproot EFT in any way
will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Section.
Informal Resolution. If you have any dispute with us, you agree that before taking any formal
action, you will contact us at <a href=mailto:TaprootEFT@gmail.com>TaprootEFT@gmail.com</a>, provide a brief, written description of the
dispute and your contact information (including your username, if your dispute relates to an
account) and allow sixty (60) days to pass, during which we will attempt to reach an amicable
resolution of any issue.
Arbitration. These Terms and each of its parts evidence a transaction involving interstate
commerce, and the Federal Arbitration Act applies in all cases and governs the interpretation and
enforcement of the arbitration rules and arbitration proceedings. Any Covered Matters must be
asserted individually in binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration
Association (“AAA”) in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Terms and the AAA
Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (including, without limitation,
utilizing desk, phone or video conference proceedings where appropriate and permitted to
mitigate costs of travel). The arbitrator shall not conduct any form of class or collective
arbitration nor join or consolidate claims by or for individuals. The arbitrator, and not any
federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute
relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including,
but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable or a particular
claim is subject to arbitration. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered
in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Award. For matters where the relief sought is over $5,000, the arbitrator’s decision will include
the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. The arbitrator
will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized
principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall
not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users but is bound by rulings in
prior arbitrations involving the same Taproot EFT user to the extent required by applicable law.
The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the
arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. THE ARBITRATOR MAY
AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY
RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY
TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT
PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER
USERS.
Exceptions. There are only two exceptions to this arbitration agreement:
First, if a party reasonably believes that the other party has in any manner infringed or threatened
to infringe the intellectual property rights of the other party, the party who owns the intellectual
property rights may seek injunctive or other appropriate interim relief in any court of competent
jurisdiction.
Second, any claim of $500 or less may, at the option of the claiming party, be resolved in small
claims court within the United States, if the claim and the parties are within the jurisdiction of
the small claims court and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an
individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.
Costs of Arbitration. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed
by the AAA’s rules, unless otherwise stated in this agreement to arbitrate. If the value of the
relief sought is $5,000 or less, at your request, Taproot EFT will reimburse you for all filing,
administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration following the earlier of the
arbitrator’s decision or settlement. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert
in the arbitration to be frivolous, Taproot EFT is relieved of its obligation to reimburse you for
any fees associated with the arbitration.
Future Amendments to the Agreement to Arbitrate. Notwithstanding any provision in the
Terms to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any amendment to this agreement to
arbitrate in the future, that amendment shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal
proceeding against Taproot EFT prior to the effective date of the amendment. The amendment
shall apply to all other disputes or claims governed by the agreement to arbitrate that have arisen
or may arise between you and Taproot EFT. If you do not agree to these amended terms, you
may close your account within thirty (30) days of the posting or notification and you will not be
bound by the amended terms.
Judicial Forum for Legal Disputes. Unless you and we agree otherwise, in the event that the
agreement to arbitrate above is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or dispute,
either as a result of your decision to opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, as a result of a decision
by the arbitrator or a court order or because you have chosen to file an eligible lawsuit in small
claims court, you agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and
Taproot EFT must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in Maricopa
County, Arizona. You and Taproot EFT agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts
located within Maricopa County, Arizona for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.
OPT-OUT. IF YOU ARE A NEW Taproot EFT USER, YOU CAN CHOOSE TO REJECT
THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE PROVISION (&ldquo;OPT-OUT&rdquo;) BY EMAILING US AN
OPT-OUT NOTICE TO <a href=mailto:TaprootEFT@gmail.com>TaprootEFT@gmail.com</a> (&ldquo;OPT-OUT NOTICE&rdquo;): Taproot EFT. THE
OPT-OUT NOTICE MUST BE RECEIVED NO LATER THAN THIRTY (30) DAYS AFTER
THE DATE YOU ACCEPT THE TERMS OF SERVICE FOR THE FIRST TIME. IF YOU
ARE NOT A NEW Taproot EFTUSER, YOU HAVE UNTIL THIRTY (30) DAYS AFTER
THE POSTING OF THE NEW TERMS OF SERVICE TO SUBMIT AN ARBITRATION OPTOUT NOTICE.
Procedure. In order to opt-out, you must email your name, address (including street address, city,
state, and zip code), and email address(es) associated with your Account(s) to which the opt-out
applies and an unaltered digital image of a valid driver’s license which matches the name on
your account to: <a href=mailto:TaprootEFT@gmail.com>TaprootEFT@gmail.com</a>. This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the
agreement to arbitrate. If you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, all other parts of the
agreement and its Disputes Section will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this agreement to
arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have
with us.
WAIVER. BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE
ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO A COURT TRIAL (OTHER THAN SMALL CLAIMS
COURT AS PROVIDED BELOW) OR TO SERVE AS A REPRESENTATIVE, AS A
PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR IN ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY,
